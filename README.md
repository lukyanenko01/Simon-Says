# Simon-Says

"Simon Says" is a two-player game that requires memory and attention. 
In the game, two players try to repeat a color sequence shown by the game. 
Each player must repeat the sequence in turn, and if they make a mistake, 
the game ends and the winner is determined by the number of completed sequences.
